;;; Commentary:

;; See the Spacemacs documentation and FAQs for instructions on how to implement
;; a new layer:
;;
;;   SPC h SPC layers RET
;;
;;
;; Briefly, each package to be installed or configured by this layer should be
;; added to `cmake-ide-packages'. Then, for each package PACKAGE:
;;
;; - If PACKAGE is not referenced by any other Spacemacs layer, define a
;;   function `cmake-ide/init-PACKAGE' to load and initialize the package.

;; - Otherwise, PACKAGE is already referenced by another Spacemacs layer, so
;;   define the functions `cmake-ide/pre-init-PACKAGE' and/or
;;   `cmake-ide/post-init-PACKAGE' to customize the package as it is loaded.

;;; Code:

;; (defconst spacemacs-cmake-ide-packages
;;   '(cmake-ide company-irony irony flycheck-rtags)
;;         )

(setq spacemacs-cmake-ide-packages
      '(cmake-ide

        ;; company-irony-c-headers
        ))
